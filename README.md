## Rocket

Rocket is an encrypted URL Shortener. It hashes the short URL locally on the user's computer and decrypts the returned data locally with the short link as key.

## Motivation

I like URL shorteners, and I wanted one of my own. At the same time, I want to protect the user's data and avoid having to know what the users share (for liabilities reasons).
Of course, the entropy given by the short link is not enough to provide top-notch security but in most cases is good enough.

## Installation

I will soon provide instructions on how to install the code.

## API Reference

I will soon add documentation for the API.
