			<h4>Rocket data collection</h4>
			<p>
				This is a list of information that the main service collects about you. This does not include what is collected by Cloudflare (our CDN) or what might be collected through our Log Files.
			</p>
			<h5>Visiting a link</h5>
			<p>
				<label>What and how?</label> If you visit a link we count it as a visit, but do not record any other information unless the link path contains 'track'. If the link path contains 'track', we collect the country where your IP is from which might then be displayed on public or private stats together.
			</p>
			<p>
				<label>How and when it is deleted?</label> This data is deleted in any of the following situations:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Within 1 year or less of the link creation</li>
				<li>The link expires</li>
				<li>The link is manually deleted</li>
			</ul>
			<h5>Creating or editing a link</h5>
			<p>
				<label>What and how?</label> We collect the data you enter on our website based on the following points:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The short link is hashed so that we cannot easily figure out what it is. We use a combination of PBKDF2 and SHA-512.</li>
				<li>The data you share (the link, text, or image) is encrypted using the short link as password (after applying some rounds of hashing with PBKDF2 and SHA-512). We use AES-GCM as our encryption algorithm.</li>
				<li>Some plaintext info reguarding how many clicks before deleting the link, in how many hours to delete the link, if the link can be deleted or edited, and if stats can be collected. If a password is set for deletion/editing/stats, we collect the hashed version of that password. To hash passwords use a combination of PBKDF2 and SHA-512.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				For more information contact us
			</p>
			<p>
				<label>How and when it is deleted?</label> This data is deleted in any of the following situations:

				<li>The link is manually deleted</li>
			</ul>
			<h5>Metering system</h5>
			<p>
				<label>What and how?</label> To protect our site from misuse, we use a taxation system, any time a query is made to our backend server, we log your IP along with a 'tax'. This data is unlikely to identify you personally.
			</p>
			<p>
				<label>How and when it is deleted?</label> This data is deleted in any of the following situations:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>When the server is restarted or turned off</li>
				<li>If you don't get banned, within 1 minute or less from the last query from your IP</li>
				<li>If you get banned, within 10 minutes from the start of the ban</li>
			</ul>
